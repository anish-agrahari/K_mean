# K_mean

Things i understand in this project:-
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics like purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences. It helps businesses understand their audience better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

Importing necessary Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.

How K-Means works:
 #Selecting a number of clusters (K).
 #Assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid.
 #Recalculating centroids iteratively until convergence.

 in this data set there was no missing values therefore we didn't do any preprocessing methods like imputation 

 
 scatter plots
